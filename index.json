This prevents users from seeing that nasty warning \u0026ldquo;This server is not trusted\u0026rdquo; You\u0026rsquo;ll know if your using SSL because the url prefix changes from http to https (s for secure).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"forcing-entire-domain-to-use-ssl\"\u003eForcing entire domain to use SSL\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou want any visit, any where to use ssl\u003c/strong\u003e. This probably the simplest solution. Create or append to your htaccess file in the top directory of your server. Some people use a port check (80 is typically http, while 443 is https) but if you have alernate configs or the user just adds :8080 to the end of the url this method is useless. Instead check whether the https environmental variable is set, if not then redirect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eRewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on\r\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{SERVER_NAME}$1 \\[R,L\\]\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"forcing-sub-domains-to-use-ssl\"\u003eForcing sub-domains to use SSL\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe \u003cstrong\u003eyou only want mysecretarea.example.com to use SSL\u003c/strong\u003e, that\u0026rsquo;s easy enough. Its the same premise as above, but you move the htaccess file into the directory that corresponds to the subdomain.
